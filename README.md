# Study-Scala

### First contact is annoyed but I sure that is a better way to lern scala.
Hi, my name is `study-scala` and I propose a learning study with, and only with, code.
Can looks little crazy idea I know.

### Ester Eggs
I think use [github](http://www.github.com) to study scala without long texts, videos and boredom explanations.

#### Contribute
It's not a hard work. It's make to be simple way `contribute-tobe-blessed`. Follow the steps...

1. Open

```scala
def Step1(file: String = "scala.script") = Source.fromFile(file).getLines.toList
```

2. Change

```scala
def Step1(file: String = "src/main/scala/org/ps/study/scala/scala.script") = Source.fromFile(file).getLines.toList
```

3. Push

```shell
git checkout master
echo "* ... your change step is here ... *"
git fetch --all & git pull
git checkout -b branch-to-fix-file-name-step1 && echo "be-clear ;)"
git add scala.script
git commit -m "$GIT_MSG_FIX"
git push origin branch-to-fix-file-name-step1
```

#### How can I help you?
I don't know... :(

#### How can you help me?
Contribute with me.

### Nice
* Don't exists explanations() => "It is for nothing and boredom".
* Explanations is the code and few comments.
* All compile.
* The test is a joke space. Enjoy :P
* If you like the following code, is the same like me! :D 
```scala
val me:BlessedForever = BlessedForever.contribute
```

### Rage Quit
* You will likely get lost in the benning.
* Do not fret!
* Love me or hate me.

# Study-English
My english is too bad, sorry, very sorry. But I wish learn more and why not.
I think use [github](http://www.github.com) to study english with pull requests.
Like this:
1. Change the README.md and put your comments.
2. I read them and response or try response them.
3. I really thank you and I desire you to be a being blessed.
4. I'm not a religious, but I'm a espiritualist.
